# Development Progress

## Completed
- [x] Plugin marketplace core infrastructure
- [x] Base encryption layer (AES-GCM implementation)
- [x] Cosmos wallet integration
- [x] Dialog system composable foundations

## In Progress
- [ ] Assistant memory persistence (50% - WIP in src/features/assistants)
- [ ] Supabase sync implementation (30% - Basic CRUD operations)
- [ ] Cross-device artifact sync (0% - Awaiting spec finalization)

## Known Issues
1. Dialog chain performance degradation with >5 sequential steps
2. Plugin sandbox memory leaks after prolonged use
3. Intermittent Supabase connection drops in low-bandwidth scenarios
4. Cosmos transaction fee estimation inaccuracy (Â±15%)

## Decision Evolution
- 2025-06-01: Selected Quasar framework over Vuetify for superior mobile capabilities
- 2025-06-05: Adopted Cosmos SDK for lower transaction costs vs Ethereum
- 2025-06-12: Migrated to IndexedDB to overcome localStorage size limitations
- 2025-06-14: Implemented memory bank system for context preservation
